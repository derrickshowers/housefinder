### v1. Simple List

Uses data from [everyhome.com](http://everyhome.com "Every Home") - scrapes the page to pull in new listings and display in a table. Also allows user to change the number of days of pulled results and filter based on a pre-determined price range (currently $300,000 to $400,000).
